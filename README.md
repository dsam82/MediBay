## Problem Solution
People often have unused extra medicines at their homes. These medicines often get past their
expiry dates and are left unused. This results in waste of money and also generates garbage. We intend to solve this solution by building a
platform to buy and sell medicines. This will reduce wastage and result in people getting
medicine, often at lower prices.
